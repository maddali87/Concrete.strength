I have predicted the compressive strength of concrete after 28 days using Machine learning which will help in avoiding time required for curing the concrete cubes for 28 days as well as save lot electrical energy and water needed for curing of concrete cubes. In this project initially I have trained various models using the data set and predicted the accuracy. after that i have used the best model based on accuracy to predict the compressive strength of concrete for test data set.
The train data set is CSV file and test data set used for prediction is excel file
